SR2012 Scaff Requirements
=========================

The following is the __bare_minimum__ amount of scaff required to
construct the arena.

 * 13 x 2m cuplock verticals
 * 13 x Feet
 * 24 x 2.5m cuplock horizontals
 *  9 x 3m cuplock horizontals
 *  5 x 1.5m cuplock horizontals
 *  4 x 2.8m plain scaff
 *  8 x Swivel couplers
 
Since this is the bare minimum, and there will inevitably be some
that's broken, this is the order that we will do instead:
 
 * 16 x 2m cuplock verticals
 * 16 x Feet
 * 29 x 2.5m cuplock horizontals
 * 11 x 3m cuplock horizontals
 *  7 x 1.5m cuplock horizontals
 *  6 x 2.8m plain scaff
 * 10 x Swivel couplers

(The above list is at least 20% more, rounded up some.)
