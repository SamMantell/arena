SR2012 Scaff Requirements
=========================

The following is the __bare_minimum__ amount of scaff required to
construct the arena.

 * 13 x 2m cuplock verticals
 * 13 x combined jack and base plate
 * 21 x 2.5m cuplock horizontals
 * 12 x 3m cuplock horizontals
 *  5 x 1.25m cuplock horizontals
 *  4 x 2.8m plain scaff
 *  8 x swivel couplers

Since this is the bare minimum, and there will inevitably be some
that's broken, this is the order that we will do instead:

 * 16 x 2m cuplock verticals
 * 16 x combined jack and base plate
 * 25 x 2.5m cuplock horizontals
 * 15 x 3m cuplock horizontals
 *  7 x 1.25m cuplock horizontals
 *  6 x 2.8m plain scaff
 * 10 x swivel couplers

(The above list is at least 20% more, rounded up some.)
