SR2012 Scaff Requirements
=========================

The following is the __bare_minimum__ amount of scaff required to
construct the arena.

 * 13 x 2m cuplock verticals
 * 13 x combined jack and base plate
 * 21 x 2.5m cuplock horizontals
 * 12 x 3m cuplock horizontals
 *  5 x 1.25m cuplock horizontals
 *  4 x 2.8m plain scaff
 *  8 x swivel couplers

Since this is the bare minimum, and there will inevitably be some
that's broken, this is the order that we will do instead:

 * 16 x 2m cuplock verticals
 * 16 x combined jack and base plate
 * 25 x 2.5m cuplock horizontals
 * 15 x 3m cuplock horizontals
 *  7 x 1.25m cuplock horizontals
 *  6 x 2.8m plain scaff
 * 10 x swivel couplers

(The above list is at least 20% more, rounded up some.)

Notes on ordering
-----------------

In both SR2012 and SR2013 there was miscommunication between the scaff
company and the person on the SR side.  "6 x 2.8m plain scaff" was
interpreted by the scaff company as six scaff **boards**.  We didn't
want these scaff boards, but obviously we had to deal with them
because the scaff company didn't want them hanging around etc.  In
future, please ensure that scaff boards are not ordered.  It was
possible to remedy this failure because we had enough spare 2.5m
horizontals for the arena diagonals.  However, this was not ideal.
