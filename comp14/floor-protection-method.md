# Method Statement: Floor Protection Installation

## Stages of Installation

### 1. Intro Talk

All people working on the installation will be briefed about the installation process, and the risks involved.

### 2. Tape and carpet protection installation

The tape will be applied to the floor, and as this is done, the plastic sheeting will be unrolled on-top of it.  The sheeting may need to be cut to fit in a small number of places.

Floor protection:

 * Helpdesk area not to be covered.
 * 8 strips required along length of room.
 * 100mm overlap of strips
 * This will leave a 3.6m x 13.4m gap at the end of the room.  This can be covered by 2 strip-widths, and will only require one more roll.

Tapes:

 * Double sided tape: Adheres floor protection to carpet. 3 strips of this underneath every strip of floor protection.  Labelled as low tack on interior of rolls: only use rolls with this "low tack" label for this purpose.
 * Joining tape:  Each strip overlaps over the top of its neighbour.  The edge of the top sheet will need securing to the bottom sheet using the joining tape.

## Hazards and Control Measures

### Injury from heavy lifting

The plastic rolls are light enough for one individual to lift them, but heavy enough for lifting them incorrectly to cause injury.  Standard recommended lifting posture should be used.

### Injury due to incorrect cutting procedure

Scissors and knives will be used to cut the plastic sheeting and tape.  Standard practices should be used when doing so to avoid injury (cut away from oneself, etc.)

## Equipment

The following equipment will be in use:

 * Scissors
 * Knives
