# Method Statement: Arena Installation

## Stages of Installation

## 1. Intro Talk
All people working on the installation will be briefed about the installation process, and the risks involved.

### 2. Carpet installation
Carpet will be rolled out and adhered to floor using tape.

### 3. Scaffold installation
A cuplock scaffolding frame will be assembled around the periphery of the arena.

### 4. Timber installation
Pine and hardboard will be installed around the base of the arena.

### 5. Dressing
Power and network cables will be attached to the top bar of the scaff.  Displays will be mounted on the top bar of this scaff.  The scaffold will then be wrapped in fabric.

### 6. Competition
The competition will then occur.

### 7. Intro talk for deconstruction
All people working on the installation will be briefed about the deconstruction process, and the risks involved.

### 8. Remove displays, cables, fabric, and timber
The displays, cables, timber, and fabric will be removed.

### 9. Remove scaffold
The cuplock scaffolding frame will be dismantled.

### 10. Remove carpet
The carpet will be removed from the floor.

## Hazards and Control Measures

## Injury from heavy lifting

The carpet reel will be heavy.  It should be lifted by at least two people at once, with standard recommended lifting posture.

The scaffold pieces are also heavy.  People performing the lifting should only lift one piece at a time.

The scaffold assembly process must be ordered to minimise the size of non-freestanding assemblies.  Non-freestanding assemblies will only be required at the beginning of the assembly of each arena's scaffold.  These assemblies must be stabilised by at least one person per vertical to prevent them from being overloaded by the weight.

### Hearing damage

The installation of cuplock is a noisy process.  Earplugs or ear defenders must be worn throughout this process.

### Damage to skin

The scaffold is often covered in abrasive substances (e.g. concrete).  Wearing scaffolding gloves will protect against this.

If a cuplock vertical is lifted without careful attention, its sliding components can slide to hit the hands.  Scaffolding gloves provide adequate protection against this.

### Standing on fixings

Screws may be left lying around on the floor during the installation.  Shoes must be worn to protect the feet from these. 

### Falling whilst dressing top scaffold bar

The top scaffold bar is at a height of approximately 2m.  Whilst dressing it, installers will need to elevate themselves to do this.

Climbing on the scaffold itself will be prohibited, as this is unstable.  Standing two or three rungs up a step-ladder will be sufficient to reach the top bar.

### Injury to non-installers

To protect people who are not part of the installation process from injury, a barrier will be erected preventing them from being present.
