This directory contains designs for the SR2015 competition 'flags'.

From the rules (rev 3):

 * Flags are wooden cubes with a side length of 250 ± 10mm.
 * The overall weight of each flag will be 2 ± 0.2kg.
 * Flags will be mounted on 4 ball casters, one in each corner of the bottom
   face. The centre of each caster will be positioned 35 ± 10mm inward from
   both adjacent edges. The lower edge of each vertical face will have a
   ground clearance of 10 ± 5mm.

A flag consists of a cube constructed out of 3mm laser cut MDF. The edges are
interlocking and the whole thing is glued together. The lid is screwed down,
rather than being glued in place, to allow it to be removed.

The base of the cube has four cut-outs for ball castors. These are inserted
from the outside of the cube, giving a ground clearance of 10.8mm.

Inside the cube there is a small compartment roughly 130x130x70mm in size.
This compartment is to hold ballast to make up the weight of the flag.
The weight of the cube without ballast should be around 1.2kg. Ballast can
be added in the form of dry sand. The compartment lid can be taped on to
prevent the sand from spilling if the flag is turned upside down.

The lid is screwed to the rest of the cube using four 3x16mm wood screws.
These screws screw into the four fixing plates glued into the top corners
of the side panels.

The panels are split up into separate DXF files (drawn with librecad). The
individual panels are grouped together into a large panel suitable for
submitting to RazorLAB:
