# SR2019 Arena Reset Checklist

When a match ends, a number of tasks have to be carried out to 'reset' the arena ready for the next match. For SR2019 they are as follows.

1. The marshalls record the state of the arena. While the marshalls work **no one** may enter or alter the arena.
2. Once both marshalls are happy that they have recorded the state of the arena correctly they hand their sheets to score entry and begin returning any moved tokens to their original positions.
3. Once the marshalls have given their sheets to score entry and have started resetting tokens, the competitors whose robots are currently in the arena may enter and retrieve their robots heading directly to destaging once they have been retrieved.
4. Once all the robots are in the destaging area the competitors with robots in staging are allowed to enter the arena and place the robot in their corner before exiting the arena and waiting in a 'waiting area' as directed by the shepherds.
