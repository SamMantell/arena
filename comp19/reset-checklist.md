# SR2019 Arena Reset Checklist

When a match ends, a number of tasks have to be carried out to 'reset' the arena ready for the next match. For SR2019 they are as follows.


In regards to tokens:

There are 10 tokens which go in each corner.
- Tokens must be colour matched to their corners
- The markers must be placed on the marked slots, in five stacks of two high
- If possible you should check the markers for damage:
    - Feel free to only check those which were actually moved in the match, but if you do spot others which are in a bad state then consider swapping them out too
    - Check that the markers on the sides of each look ok (aren't torn or badly scratched)
    - Check that the tape on the edges of each are ok (isn't coming off)
    - If a token has issues then swap it out for fresh ones or repair; if there aren't spare ones to hand, swap the less good ones into positions in the stacks which are less often moved by robots

In regards to the arena:

 - Look for any robot debris and if any is found hand to a badger to be place in destaging/disposed of
 - Cast a quick eye over the zone marking tape to ensure it's still stuck down
    - If it's not, and you can quickly stick it back down then do so and report to head judge so they can consider a better fix later
    - If it's particularly bad, consider replacing it fully (consult the head judge on whether it's worth delaying matches for this)
 - Inspect the carpet on the volcano to ensure its fully stuck down
    - If it's not, and you can quickly stick it back down then do so and report to head judge so they can consider a better fix later
    - If it's particularly bad, consider replacing the tape (consult the head judge on whether it's worth delaying matches for this)
 - Periodically visually inspect the arena walls for damage
    - Minor damage can be fixed with white gaff as necessary report to head judge so they can consider a better fix later
    - Major damage should be reported to head judge
 - Periodically visually inspect the carpet
    - Minor damage can be re taped down report to head judge so they can consider a better fix later
    - Major damage should be reported to head judge
